Title: BeautifulBeautifulStory
Date: Reviewed in the United States on August 18, 2019
Review: I just finished this book and should probably wait until tomorrow to write a review because my tears are blinding me. I read it because I have been looking for a book that my grandson might like as much as he loved Because of Winn Dixie. He is in 5th grade this year and says he didn't even like to read until he read that book. I don't know right this minute if this is a story we will read this year, because the subject of homelessness is heartbreaking. Then again, it was just last week that my grandson was with me when we got to the end of a ramp and saw the homeless woman with a dog at her side. She was sobbing as we stopped to give her what we could. So, the problem is real, and he saw it first-hand. This story, for all its sadness, is one of hope, of family not always being those related to us. It is one of community and connectedness. I absolutely loved it, and if I were still teaching 6th grade, it is one I would read with my class. Highly recommended.

Review: The author, Bobbie Pyron, has hit another home run out of the park with her new book for middle school: Stay.This book takes the reader on a journey along with Piper and the new friends Piper makes along the journey she takes with her family. You see, Piper‚Äôs family hit a series of bumps along the road of life & they became homeless.After her family became homeless, Piper had to pack up very few belongings (among them her cherished copy of My Side of the Mountain) & hit the road.Piper & her family finally make it to a big city where they end up in a family shelter (Hope House), but Piper misses her old house, friends & her privacy terribly. In Hope House, Piper‚Äôs family has to share one room & she also has to share a bed with her little brother (who wets the bed)The other thing Piper hates about her new life is being labeled the homeless girl at her new school. Her new classmates know she is homeless, because she rides the homeless bus to school & has a special donated backpack.Yet, while living at Hope House with her family, Piper develops new friendships with the girls in the Firefly Girls Troop 423 (Piper was a Firefly Girl where she used to live). Her new friends in the Firefly Girls Troop, help her deal with some of the emotions she has been feeling recently.Piper also makes friends with a sweet street dog named Baby, who lives with his owner Jewel in the local public park (along with some other homeless people & their pets). These homeless people live in the public park, because the homeless shelters won‚Äôt take in their pets.Then, things get exciting when Baby‚Äôs owner gets really, really sick and ends up in the hospital. At first, no one knows which hospital Jewel has ended up in, but eventually one Jewel‚Äôs friends locates her.This friend, Ree, smuggles Baby inside the hospital for a visit, because the friend knows this is the best possible medicine for Jewel. After Baby visited the hospital with Ree, he decides to go back to the hospital on his own (because he really wants to be with his owner Jewel). Well, let‚Äôs just say that things didn‚Äôt work out so good & animal control came and took Baby to the animal shelter.When Piper learns of these developments, she knows that she must help out Baby and his owner Jewel. Thus begins a big mystery to discover who Jewel really is and where she was possibly going before ending up on the streets of the big city.Piper & her new friends have limited time to solve the mystery surrounding Jewel‚Äôs past, before the animal shelter lets a new family adopt Baby (taking him away from Jewel for good). Can Piper and her new friends solve the mystery in time?To find out what happens to Piper, Baby and Jewel, run out & grab a copy of this heartfelt animal story today. You won‚Äôt be disappointed in the adventure you will have with Piper and her new friends.

Title: Lotstoloveinthismiddlegradenoveltoldfrommultipleperspectives
Date: Reviewed in the United States on September 19, 2019
Review: This middle grade novel is a feel-good dog story, but it‚Äôs also so much more than that.Piper and her family have had a lot of changes since her dad lost his job. Her family has become homeless, moving from place to place as her parents look for work. As they try to adjust to their new reality at the shelter where they‚Äôre living, Piper meets a homeless woman named Jewel and her dog, Baby. Even though she‚Äôs dealing with her own family‚Äôs crisis, when Jewel gets sick and needs to be hospitalized, Piper is determined to make sure Jewel and Baby stay together.Things I loved about this novel: Piper‚Äôs selflessness, despite her own family‚Äôs situation; the storytelling of family homelessness and mental illness is raw and real for middle grade readers; the power of a group (Piper‚Äôs Firefly Troop) coming together to help those in need.Told in alternating points of view between Piper, Baby and Jewel, this story will be a hit with readers.

Title: Greatbook
Date: Reviewed in the United States on July 8, 2020
Review: When we were going to school I checked this book out but did not read it. I wanted this book on Amazon so I got it. It was pretty hard to read sad and scary I am only a 4th grader. There are homeless people in the book which can be very hard to read and the story is very sad but Piper and her friends try to save a old women life and a little dog which name is Baby. I would really recommend this book to all people who can handle homeless. I really was surpriesd that this book was this SAD!! My grandma wanted me to read this book again because I did not want to read it for a long time but then I read it again great.OVER ALL GREAT BOOK.

Title: Humblingstorysmokingcharacter
Date: Reviewed in the United States on October 21, 2021
Review: Stay has a pretty good story line. It teaches compassion for the homeless and animals. I just didn't feel like this book was a real page turner. I normally read a book like this in about two days. This one took close to two weeks to get through because it was so predictable to me. But it should be great for the younger audience for which it's intended.There also is a character who smokes cigarettes for those who find that concerning. As an ex-smoker myself, I think the author could have left that out.

Review: This was a strong story that will make the reader realize how fortunate they are if they have a roof over their heads.I hope in reading this story compassion for the less fortunate will also be found. I'm talking about compassion for animals as well as for people who have much less and don't even know what the day or night will bring. It's a scary world and as Jewel said "there's bad people in the world but mostly good" I sure hope that's true because sometimes it doesn't feel like it.

Review: I love how it helps people understand that just because families are homeless doesn't mean they aren't trying. Life just ruins things sometimes. Love the story so much.
